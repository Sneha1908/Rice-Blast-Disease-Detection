# üåæ Rice Blast Disease Detection System

An AI-powered deep learning system for **early detection and stage-wise classification** of rice blast disease from rice leaf images. This precision farming tool integrates:

-  A lightweight CNN classifier (EfficientNetB0) to validate input as Rice Leaf / Non-Rice Leaf / Non-Leaf  
-  YOLOv5n model to detect infected regions and classify disease progression into **six stages** (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9)  
-  ESRGAN-based image enhancer for improved visibility of subtle lesions  
-  A Flutter mobile application for real-time predictions on device  
-  Flask-based backend API to handle detection and communication

The system improves accuracy and reduces delays in disease management by replacing manual inspection with automated image-based analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-  **CNN-Based Leaf Classification**  
  Classifies images into: `RICE LEAF`, `NOT A RICE LEAF`, or `NOT A LEAF` using EfficientNetB0.

-  **YOLOv5-Based Stage Detection**  
  Identifies infected areas and classifies rice blast disease into six progression stages: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

-  **Image Enhancement (ESRGAN)**  
  Improves low-resolution or blurry leaf images using super-resolution techniques.

-  **Mobile App (Flutter)**  
  Allows farmers to upload images directly from their phone and view disease stage and treatment advice in real time.

-  **Flask Backend API**  
  Handles classification, enhancement, and detection workflows.

-  **Stage-Based Recommendations**  
  Returns specific agricultural advice based on the detected stage of infection.

### üîÅ Architecture Layers

1. **Input Layer (Flutter App)**
   - Users upload leaf images through the mobile interface.
   - Sends the image via HTTP POST to the backend API.

2. **CNN Classification (EfficientNetB0)**
   - Validates if the image is a `RICE LEAF`, `NON-RICE LEAF`, or `NON-LEAF`.
   - Rejects invalid inputs before moving to detection.

3. **Image Enhancement (Real-ESRGAN)**
   - Optional enhancement step.
   - Improves clarity of leaf texture and lesion visibility.

4. **YOLOv5 Stage Detection**
   - Runs object detection to locate disease lesions.
   - Classifies into one of six progression stages (0 to 9).
   - Annotates the image and returns stage-wise prediction with confidence.

5. **Treatment Recommendation Engine**
   - Based on detected stage, the system returns a customized advice message (e.g., fungicide dosage, irrigation suggestions).

6. **Frontend Response**
   - The app displays:
     - Predicted class
     - Stage (if applicable)
     - Confidence
     - Annotated output image
     - Recommendation
